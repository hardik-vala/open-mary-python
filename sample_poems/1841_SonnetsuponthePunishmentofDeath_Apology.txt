1   The formal World relaxes her cold chain
2   For One who speaks in numbers; ampler scope
3   His utterance finds; and, conscious of the gain,
4   Imagination works with bolder hope
5   The cause of grateful reason to sustain;
6   And, serving Truth, the heart more strongly beats
7   Against all barriers which his labour meets
8   In lofty place, or humble Life's domain.
9   Enough;---before us lay a painful road,
10   And guidance have I sought in duteous love
11   From Wisdom's heavenly Father. Hence hath flowed
12   Patience, with trust that, whatsoe'er the way
13   Each takes in this high matter, all may move
14   Cheered with the prospect of a brighter day.
